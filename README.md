# PCA for Biomedical Image Analysis
Fingerprint Orientation Normalization Using PCA


Ever wondered why your phone doesn’t ask you to place your thumb **perfectly straight** on the fingerprint sensor?

This is because many biometric systems use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to automatically correct the orientation of fingerprints (and other similar biomedical images) before matching. This project demonstrates exactly how that works.

This technique is part of **biomedical image analysis**, where orientation normalization helps improve consistency, pattern matching, and recognition accuracy — especially in tasks like fingerprint authentication.
